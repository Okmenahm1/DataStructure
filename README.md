# Data Structures and Algorithms Project Suite

This repository contains four individual projects developed in Java, showcasing practical implementations of essential data structures and algorithms. Each project demonstrates the use of **Linked Lists**, **Stacks**, **Queues**, **Heaps**, **Hash Tables** And **AVL Trees** through real-world applications with a JavaFX user interface (without Scene Builder).

## üìö Projects Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Employee Records Management System

**Structures Used**: `ArrayList`, `TableView`, `File Handling`  
**Description**:  
A JavaFX-based system to manage employee records. The application allows users to:
- Import employee data from a file (`employee.txt`)
- Display records in a table format
- Search, insert, and delete employee entries
- Group and count employees by age, gender, and department
- Export updated data to `updatedEmployee.txt`

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Student Admission Management System

**Structures Used**: `Singly Linked Lists`  
**Description**:  
A student and major admission system using linked lists to manage:
- Student and major data insertion, deletion, and search
- Admission mark calculation using weighted Tawjihi and placement test scores
- Auto-suggestion of alternative majors for unaccepted students
- Statistical reporting (acceptance rates, top N accepted students, etc.)
- File I/O for loading student and criteria data

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Airport Check-in and Boarding System

**Structures Used**: `Linked Lists`, `Queues`, `Stacks` (Undo/Redo)  
**Description**:  
A flight management system that includes:
- Check-in and boarding processes for Regular and VIP passengers
- Undo and Redo functionalities for flight operations
- Queues per flight for each passenger type
- Tracking of boarded and canceled passengers via linked lists
- GUI-based file logs and statistics (e.g., total boarded/canceled per status)

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Movie Catalog Management System

**Structures Used**: `Hash Table with AVL Tree Chaining`  
**Description**:  
An advanced movie catalog app using a hash table with AVL trees to handle collisions. Features include:
- Add, update, delete, and search movies
- AVL tree balancing and automatic hash table resizing
- JavaFX interface for table display, search filters, and movie operations
- File support for saving and loading the movie catalog
- Statistics like top/least rated movies and tree heights

## üíª Technologies Used

- JavaFX (manual layout only)
- Object-Oriented Design
- GUI Event-Driven Programming

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- All projects were implemented from scratch as academic assignments.
- Scene Builder was not used, all JavaFX layouts were coded manually.
